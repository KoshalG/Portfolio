                        <br>
                        <p>HTML is the language of the web. It is the foundation
                            of
                            every website and web application. It is the first
                            thing
                            that you need to learn when you start your journey
                            as a
                            web developer. It is a very simple language to learn
                            and
                            understand. But there are some good practices that
                            you
                            should follow while writing HTML code. In this blog,
                            I
                            will be discussing some of these practices.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Always Declare a Doctype</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Doctype stands for Document Type Declaration. It is
                            an
                            instruction to the web browser about what version of
                            HTML
                            the page is written in. It is the first thing that
                            you
                            should write in your HTML document.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Always use UTF-8 as the character encoding</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>UTF-8 is the preferred encoding format for HTML5
                            documents. It is the most widely used encoding
                            format.
                            It supports all the characters of all the languages
                            in
                            the world. It is also the default encoding format
                            for
                            HTML5 documents. So, you don't need to specify it
                            explicitly. But it is a good practice to specify it
                            explicitly.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Always use lowercase for tags and attributes</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>HTML is not case sensitive. So, you can use uppercase
                            or
                            lowercase for tags and attributes. But it is a good
                            practice to use lowercase for tags and attributes.
                            It
                            makes your code more readable and maintainable.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Always use double quotes for attributes</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>HTML allows you to use single quotes or double quotes
                            for
                            attributes. But it is a good practice to use double
                            quotes for attributes. It makes your code more
                            readable
                            and maintainable.
